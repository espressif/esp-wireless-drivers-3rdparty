config MBEDTLS_SSL_MAX_CONTENT_LEN
    int "TLS maximum message content length"
    default 16384
    range 512 16384
    help
        Maximum TLS message length (in bytes) supported by mbedTLS.
        
        16384 is the default and this value is required to comply
        fully with TLS standards.
        
        However you can set a lower value in order to save RAM. This
        is safe if the other end of the connection supports Maximum
        Fragment Length Negotiation Extension (max_fragment_length,
        see RFC6066) or you know for certain that it will never send a
        message longer than a certain number of bytes.
        
        If the value is set too low, symptoms are a failed TLS
        handshake or a return value of MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_INVALID_RECORD
        (-0x7200).

config MBEDTLS_DEBUG
   bool "Enable mbedTLS debugging"
   default "no"
   help
       Enable mbedTLS debugging functions.
       
       If this option is enabled, use the mbedtls_debug_set_threshold()
       and mbedtls_ssl_conf_dbg() functions to obtain debugging output
       from mbedTLS.
       
       Note thatm mbedTLS debugging is not related to the ESP logging
       functionality. See the "https_request_main" example for a
       sample function which connects the two together.
